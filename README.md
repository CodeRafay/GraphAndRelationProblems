# GraphAndRelationProblems
A collection of C++ programs solving classic discrete structures problems, including relation properties (symmetry, reflexivity, transitivity),Logic Equivalence Check, graph walks, and adjacency matrix analysis. These solutions demonstrate key concepts in discrete mathematics and graph theory.
